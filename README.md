# Code Quiz

The task for this Project was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. A Welcome screen invites the User to answer questions about coding. Once a button is clicked, a timer starts counting backwards from 60 seconds, and the questions with their possible answers appear. A correct choice is acknowledged, and the next question appears; however, if the User makes a wrong choice, 10 seconds are deducted from the time remaining. The User has an opportunity to answer questions until there are no more, or until the timer counts down to Zero. At that point, the User can save his/her initials and score to the page.


### Project Motivation

This Project simulates part of what happens at many coding job interviews: a coding assessment. This is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. It is also a way for students to practice their coding skills using JavaScript to dynamically-update HTML and CSS. We need to build Event Listeners to execute functions when buttons are clicked, a Timer that is capable of 'recognizing' a wrong answer and reducing the amount of time by 10 seconds while also decrementing from 60 seconds to zero, and resetting for a new round, and Questions dynamically rendered and appearing sequentially, and a Scorekeeper that tallies and records the User's score and initials. This is a significant beginning to an education in the capabilities of JavaScript.


### Resources

For guidance, one is given a GIF to watch the application in action, a brief step-by-step description of how the application should function, and what components are required to build it. Multiple-choice questions are created by the coder. Personal resources I have relied on for the completion of this project include my patient, hard-working TA's, my even-more patient tutor, Kris Renaldi, and my colleague, Steven Mccarther, who has discussed and shared his insights on all of the exercises we have had to complete: thanks again, Steven!
